# fifo-algorithm-visualization
This project provides a visualization of the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) page replacement algorithm, a fundamental concept in operating systems and memory management. The visualization helps users understand how the FIFO algorithm works by simulating the process step by step.

# Features
Visualization of the FIFO page replacement algorithm.
User-friendly graphical interface.
Input your own page reference string for visualization.
Real-time updates of page frames and replacement status.

# gitclone
git clone https://github.com/Riyadayananda/fifo-algorithm-visualization.git

# Compile the program (requires FreeGLUT):
gcc -o fifo_visualization fifo_visualization.c -lglut -lGLU -lGL -lm

# run 
./fifo_visualization

Follow the command-line prompts to enter the length of the page reference string and the page references themselves.

Enjoy the visualization of the FIFO page replacement algorithm!
